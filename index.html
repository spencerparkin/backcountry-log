		<h1>Spencer's Backcountry Log</h1>
		<p>
		I have a hard time staying away from the backcountry.
		There's generally not much contraversy about going there alone; but in winter time,
		if you don't have someone who can dig you out, then it's generally frowned upon.
		But for me, I either go alone, or I don't go at all.  This is because, I'm sad to say,
		I don't make or keep friends easily.  It's not because I'm disagreeable or hard to get along with.  It's because I usually slow other people down.
		</p>
		<p>
		Anyhow, here I plan to keep a list of log entries about my outings, because it's always good to
		reflect on what went well, what didn't, where you made mistakes, etc., so that you can
		hopefully learn something.  Of course, as I learned in one of my avi-courses, the backcountry
		is a wicked learning environment--you don't always get to learn from mistakes (e.g., the fatal ones),
		and the backcountry can re-enforce incorrect lessons (e.g., this slope never slides.)  But while
		I'm still alive, there is, of course, always something to write about.
		</p>
		<p>
		The first several entries will have to be from memory of last season, since I'm starting the log this year (2020 to 2021 ski season.)
		Moving forward, I'll try to write something about each outing shortly there-after.  I don't plan to
		document every outing, since some aren't worth mentioning, but some are.
