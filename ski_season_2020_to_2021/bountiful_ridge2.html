		<h1>Bountiful Ridge (Again)</h1>
		<p>
		The last time I had visited B-ridge this season, the conditions were absolutely
		terrible.  Well, I went back there finally yesterday, and conditions were much better.
		</p>
		<p>
		The approach was very difficult, and almost turned me back a few times.  The road
		up North Canyon had to be booted for the most part, and the low-elevation snow from
		the trail up to KPF, then to Rudy's, and even up to Rectangle peak, was often wet,
		but sometimes dry.  When you alternate between these two, you invariably get huge
		globs of snow sticking to your skins, making your skis super heavy, and eliminating
		all glide you otherwise would have had.  My skins were compromized from KPF all the
		way to Crescent Peak.
		</p>
		<p>
		Fortunately, after using the handle of my pole to knock off all the snow stuck to my
		skins, I didn't have any more skinning problems for the rest of the day.  Up higher,
		the snow was relatively much dryer, or even completely dry in some places.  I did have
		some residual skin wax on my skins; I'm not sure how much that helped.
		</p>
		<p>
		Correlated with the UAC forecast for the day, I did notice while skinning some new
		surface snow that wanted to slide on old snow not too far beneath it, but it never
		felt significantly unstable, and it was only in isolated areas.  The overall danger
		rating for the day with green on low and mid-elevation slopes, but not high elevation.
		I never reached the high elevation range.
		</p>
		<p>
		I can't help but wonder if I'm skiing these slopes, though, without good enough reasons
		for why I think they may be safe to ride.  Certainly doing so without someone else there
		who could possibly dig you out is highly questionable.  It's hard to stay away from the
		mountains, and if I only went when I had a partner, then I'd almost never go.
