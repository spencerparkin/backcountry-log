		I figured there might be enough snow to go visit PP3 today (we are well below where we should be
		for our snowpack depth this year), and Melinda gave
		me the whole day to hike, so I went.  It was a humbling experience as I was reminded
		of just how terrible I am at backcountry skiing.  Maybe I just need to get back into
		the groove?  I don't know.  It had been a while.
		</p>
		<p>
		I tried to route-find a safe way up to The Cone.  My only mistake, I think, was
		skinning up a short-but-steep embankment right after a streem crossing.  Even very
		small avalanches can bury you; especially if snow piles up in a terrain trap;
		in this case, the streem bed.  Everything else on approach was sub-30, and I kept
		away from anything that could slide above me.
		</p>
		<p>
		I saw lots of cracking and felt some collapsing, which was very consistent with
		what's been forecasted almost every day for weeks.  We have quite a bad snowpack setup
		right now--slabs over sugar to the ground everywhere there's enough coverage to ski anything.
		There have been a lot of remote triggers, which means the pack is super touchy.
		</p>
		<p>
		I did avoid the major terrain trap typically skied on exiting PP3.  It had lots of
		tracks going down it, but I knew better, and avoided it completely.
		</p>
		<p>
		I saw tons of people up there, and was never alone on The Cone all day.  It was fun to see other people,
		and I don't mind the competition for powder.  There wasn't much to begin with anyway.
		If I want fresh tracks, I'll go to B-ridge.  Owen is skeptical that even B-ridge can be
		relied upon for fresh tracks these days, but I think that's more-so the case for the runs
		almost immediately above Rudy's Flat.  I'm willing to go much further, and often do.
		</p>
		<p>
		I brought the wrong skis.  At some point, the equipment doesn't matter.  (i.e., there are no
		bad skis, just bad skiers.)  But in my own defense, the super light-weight setup I had
		was not a good choice for the chopped up powder.  I needed a heaver ski that could cut
		through the chop, and my crows would have served that purpose well.  I probably still
		would have crashed a few times, but I'm sure I would have skied better and more confidently.
		</p>
		<p>
		I crashed three times, to be precise.  The third crash resulted in my tech binding popping off
		one of my legs!  I hooked a tip and then felt my leg torque.  It was a hard crash, and I could
		feel how my leg was strained, but fortunately, I didn't feel any lasting effects.
		So those tech bindings do work; they do release; but it does take more force than usual to
		get them to pop.
		</p>
		<p>
		What's also scary is that at the end of the day, I was so tired that I forgot to unlock
		my toe before skiing out!  Despite so much crashing earlier in the day, amazingly, I didn't
		crash on the way out, but almost did a few times.
		</p>
		<p>
		Apparently the wax-job I did on my skis was phenomoninal!  My skis were sliding super quick
		across the snow.  I don't know how long the wax will stay effective, but I can always wax them again.
		It's nice to know I can do that myself without taking the skis to a shop, but my wax
		supply is limited.
		</p>
		<p>
		Anyhow, the whole experience on this day has just re-enforced my believe that I'm just
		way too slow for Owen Reeder or John Mills.  Though they'd never want to ski with me,
		I would never ask.  I would just slow them down, and they'd hate me for it.
		</p>
		<p>
		What's more, I should really wear a helmet more often in the back-country.  My rock-climbing
		helmet isn't too much of a burdent to take; so I should.
		</p>
		<p>
		I need to learn to porpoise my skis in the powder.  I think this is a really hard skill to learn,
		mainly because you frequently need the opportunity to ski fresh, deep, untouched powder--something
		very hard to come by in the Wasatch unless you have some good secrets or a helicopter.
		</p>
		<p>
		Supposedly, the idea is to turn your skis just as they pop out of the powder.  If you're going fast
		enough with your feet together, you'll build up enough compressed snow under your skis to have them jump
		up out of the snow.
		</p>
		<h2>Revisited 12-29-2020</h2>
		<p>
		I went back to PP3 yesterday, but brought my Crows.  They're heavier (and therefore, more
		stable over choppy snow) and have more surface area (so they float better.)
		They are certainly a better choice for this area given the type of snow encountered and the
		length of the tour.  Also, I only crashed once, so that's also better.
		</p>
		<p>
		I had been in talks with an old acquaintance of mine, Ladislav, to go up there with him,
		but he's too afraid of Covid, and doesn't want to get up early.  I get Covid, but not getting
		up early?  Whatever.  He might also be concerned about getting his new setup damaged, which is also
		absurd.  Backcountry equipment takes a lot of punishment.  That's just the name of the game.
		</p>
		<p>
		So far this year (the year of Covid!), our snowpack depth totals have been absolutely awful.
		There is not much to ski, and what little snow there is on the ground is faceting (due to
		shallow snowpack depth and cold clear nights), or has terrible structure (i.e., strong over
		weak snow) due to weeks and weeks of earlier faceting under the same set of conditions.
		</p>
		<h2>Revisited 12-31-2020</h2>
		<p>
		This was a good way to end the year.  I felt like I skied much better today.  In fact,
		I did 8 laps--6 off the cone, and then 2 off the little hill north of the cone.  One
		of my runs off the cone was into the forbidden fruit area--Bear Trap.  A team of 6 skiers
		were lapping it, and I decided to follow them.  Again, just because someone skied something,
		this doesn't mean it's safe to ski!  Plus, they had each other's back, but not mine.
		</p>
		<p>
		The cone has avalanched in the past.  Its north, maybe north-east aspect--in any case, its
		steepest aspect--is what slid, I believe.  That part of the cone had no tracks on it at all today,
		which is no surprise.
		But remember, all the snow is connected, so a disturbance on an adjacent part of the slope
		could trigger it, and an avalanche that releases can pull snow off less steep slopes.
		</p>
		<p>
		Anyhow, I approached the forbidden fruit by first checking the slope angle (it was about
		29 degrees.)  I then skied down a bit, then checked it again (30 or so degrees.)  The
		slope then rolls over into the trees at about 32 or 33 degrees, which is exciting, but
		pushing it for someone solo touring.
		</p>
		<p>
		At the start of the day I caught up with a young man from out-of-state saying he was headed
		to Powder Park.  When I saw him go totally the wrong way, I asked him if he knew where
		he was going to get there.  He didn't.  I showed him the way.  Of course, I was way too
		slow for him (being old and fat.)  Once we found the final skinner, I told him to leave
		me behind.  He was a nice kid, but didn't seem too appreciative.  I could have made
		the cone well before he did by just not saying anything.  We were the first on the scene,
		because we started out in the dark by headlamp.
		</p>
		<p>
		Skinning alone in the dark by headlamp is always disconcerting.  I'm always afraid I'm
		going to get trampled by a moose or eaten by a bear or mountain lion, so it was sure
		nice to have his company today, unlike my last two outings up Mill D.
		</p>
		<p>
		I pushed it today with the 8th lap.  I was tired, but the snow was so good, I had to
		do one more.  It was just skiing better for me; I don't know why.  I'd like to think
		I'm getting better, but I somehow think it's just because conditions were more
		resort-like; I don't know.  There was still plenty of chopped-up snow and al-natural terrain.
		</p>
		<p>
		What's perhaps more miraculous, here's some footage from this day that doesn't contain
		any swearing.
