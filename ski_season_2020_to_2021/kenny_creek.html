			My original goal was some west-facing trees near the bottom of Rocky Basin, but I didn't
			feel good about the snow conditions.  Ironically, the east-facing slope I had to ski down
			to get into Rocky Basin, and skin up to get out, was probably more suspect.  So that was
			probably a dumb mistake.

			Fortunately, I caught Kenny Bowl (the large swath of skiable terrain north and east
			of Kenny Creek Cabin) in really good condition.  There was a hard crust under the
			powder, but other than that, it was pretty amazing snow to ski.  Plus, the slope angles
			are quite moderate in this area.  It does pitch over 30 in some places, but you can
			avoid much of that by your choice of descent.

			Though there is a great deal of skiable terrain here, it is not often skied due to its solar
			aspects not keeping good snow, and possibly due to the approach.  Fortunately, I was able
			to ski down the gas pipeline, and this saved a great deal of time off my exit for the day.

			It's clear from the video that I'm horribly out of shape and a horrible skier.
