		Here, by "shoulders", I mean I skied off points near, but not on, the peak.
		There is a pretty crazy chute coming off Bountiful Peak's east face from very
		near the top.  It's obviously the highest-prized line of the peak, but I would
		not dare even try it, just admire it from the bottom.  Owen has skied it.

		This tour is a good example, to me, of the attitude you have to have for adventurous
		backcountry skiing.  If all you care about is great turns in great snow, and linking
		zillions of them consecutively, then you'll never want to explore in the backcountry,
		because doing so is trial-and-error, and much of the time, you return empty-handed
		in terms of great skiing.
		</p>
		<p>
		However, in terms of beautiful views, fresh air, exercise,
		and just a general love of being in the mountains exploring, you never leave empty-handed.
		You have to be someone who enjoys the entire journey--the up as well as the down--in
		order to eventually discover those places in the mountains where there is really good skiing.
		I like to think of such skiing, really, as just a bonus.

		I didn't find anything that great on this tour, but that doesn't mean it wasn't worth doing.
		I also realize that I didn't, and often don't, find things in the best of condition, and so
		I need to try coming back at a different time.

		I skied the south shoulder of the peak onto the eastern side, then skinned north,
		then skied a run off the north shoulder that Owen has skied a few times in his ski videos,
		but under much better conditions.  That, in fact, was the motivation of the entire tour.
		I watched his videos of the run, and decided I wanted to try to find it and ski it.
		I was successful, but the run was in pretty poor condition, and the wind was insane.
