		This was risk on a few fronts.  First, there's always the risk of dying in an avalanche,
		or getting injurred enough that you can't get out on your own power.  The other, less
		serious risk, was that of simply going somewhere that might be stupid and not worth-while.
		The idea for this day was to see if there was something or anything interesting to ski
		on the east side of Thurstan Peak, and the peak did not disappoint.
		</p>

		There's definitely a lot of interesting terrain to ski on Thurstan Peak's eastern flank.
		I didn't happen to get it in very good condition for the principle run, but there was an
		apron lower down on a more solar aspect where the sun had made the snow much easier to ski.

		The third risk I took was to ski a chute I decided to climb up.  I had to keep re-evaluating
		the whole idea as I ascended, calculating in my mind whether I thought I could actually
		ski it.  I tend to sometimes overestimate what I can ski, so I'm glad I made it down the
		chute unscathed.  As you can see from the video, my descent was pretty stupid, but I do
		feel somewhat accomplished for having gone down it.  Yes, I stopped several times, for long
		periods to collect myself, but I can say I kept the skis on the whole time, and the chute
		was kind-of neat.  It was probably the steepest thing I've ever skied.

		I chose to bring ice-axe and boot-crampons last minute, and was sure glad I brought them.  They
		are extra weight, but they were instrumental in reaching the peak.  There was a lot of
		terrain I needed to ascend that wasn't really skinnable, even with ski-crampons, and it just
		made more sense to boot it.  The snow was very firm and supportable for walking, which is
		a good sign on a spring ski anyways, because you want to confirm there was an overnight re-freeze.
		You then want to hit the slopes once they thaw just enough to give good turning, but you can't
		overstay your welcome.  You have to get out before wet-slides become an issue.
