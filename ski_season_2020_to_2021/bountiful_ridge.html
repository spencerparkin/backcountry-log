		All season I've been both waiting for enough snow to ski B-Ridge, but also too
		afraid of how unstable things are up there.  We got a good storm in early November,
		and then the snow just sat around and rotted for weaks.  I went up there in early
		December to look at it, and it was sugar to the ground; not a good start to the
		snowpack as a great deal more weight typically gets added on top of that, eventually.
		</p>
		<p>
		But we really haven't added much to it at all.  We've been in a drought.  It snows here
		and there, but not much, and few and far between.  The UAC has been beating the drum
		all season that we have a very shallow and weak snowpack due to the tremendoush amount
		of sugar snow at the ground that everything else is sitting on.  Today I found that
		B-ridge is no exception to this.  (Also, shallow snowpacks are typically more dangerous
		because temporature gradients are higher, and therefore faceting occurs more often, I think.)
		</p>
		<p>
		My pit profiles showed hard crusty snow to the ground, then very weak snow just above the top
		of the main crust (underwhich it was crusty to the ground, but not as crusty as where
		the main crust was.)  Above the weak snow was more cohesive snow to the surface.
		I couldn't get the more cohesive snow to fail on the layer just above the crust, but I
		always wonder if I'm somehow failing to isolate my columns.
		</p>
		<p>
		Anyhow, it turned out that the main instability problem of the day was sloughing of
		what little snow fell the night before.  Apparently it didn't bond well with the old
		surface snow.  If it had snowed a lot more, then I may have triggered a major avalanche,
		or perhaps a failure could have occurred on (or stepped down to) the weak layer above
		the main crust.
		</p>
		<p>
		Maybe I have no idea what I'm talking about.  I really feel like an idiot when it comes
		to snowpack evaluation.  The best I can do is stay sub-30, which should be a golden rule
		if you're going to ski alone anyway.
		</p>
		<p>
		As I approached B-ridge, it became immediately clear that if there was any hope of being
		able to ski anything (due to there being so little snow covering the slopes), then it had
		to be Mark's Ghost South.  It's roughly north-east, shaded, and low 30s, but steep enough
		to slide.  It's the only place where all season's snow to-date may have both accumulated
		and not evaporated.  Still, it was too shallow to ski.
		</p>
		<p>
		The best take-way I can think of right now is that I just don't feel safe trying to ski
		this slope again this season if we do finally get a big dump from mother nature.  I would
		have to be sure that the avalanche dragon was wet-slides instead of slabs, and that we
		had a good freeze-thaw cycle going on, and that everything was welded.  (I.e., it would
		have to be a Spring ski.)
		</p>
		<p>
		The solar aspects have patches of snow here and there, but are mostly bare.  It's a sad
		situation.  By this time of year, there should be a lot more snow.
		</p>
		<p>
		Anyhow, after triggering some sloughs today, I'm kind of spooked that I ever skied
		Mark's Ghost South in the past.  Did I ever
		have enough information to justify that it was an acceptable risk?  I could ask the same
		question about almost every other slope I've skied above 30 degrees.
		</p>
		<p>The bottom line is that you <i>must</i>
		have good reasons (plural!) why a slope is safe to ski before you ever consider skiing it.
		Otherwise, you're just rolling the dice, and the odds are not in your favor.  It would also
		help if someone was with you who could dig you out.
