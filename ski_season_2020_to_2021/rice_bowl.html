		This was probably the best day in the backcountry I've ever had skiing.  The snow was great,
		and I felt like my skiing wasn't completely horrible.  I linked many turns without stopping to
		catch my breath, and I was able to spoon the runs together too.  The end result was several
		tracks down the mountain that you could look back on and be proud of.  But pride is bad, so
		I'll just say, thankful for.
		</p>
		<p>
		And if that wasn't good enough, I also ran into a fellow backcountry skier named Brett (I forget
		his last name.)  Owen is a mutual friend of ours.  Brett was a veteran of backcountry skiing,
		and it showed.  For as long as I've been trying to backcountry ski, I've always wanted to ski
		with someone who actually knew what they were doing.  It was short-lived, but it was still fun
		to talk with him.  I probably should have picked his brain a bit more while I had the opportunity,
		but oh well.

		I did not take enough provisions with me on this trip.  I had sunscreen and actually used it, thankfully.
		But I didn't bring enough food and water.

		It's always interesting to see, such as on days like this, all the snow you encounter on the approach
		is completely awful, but once you finally reach your destination, the snow is amazing.  The key is
		the aspect and elevation of the target slope.  You can't give up hope while on route until you
		reach the desired aspect and elevation.

		<p>
		The tour coming up the Farmington Spine works out well, because after skiing Rice Bowl for a while,
		it gives the approach snow time to soften so that it's more skiable on the way out.
