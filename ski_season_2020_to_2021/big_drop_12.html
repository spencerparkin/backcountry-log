		<h1>Big Drop 12</h1>
		<p>
			I decided to text John the morning I woke up and decided to visit
			B-ridge.  Amazingly, he agreed to go with me!
		</p>
		<p>
			A week ago, I think we had some communications about skiing together,
			but it fell through.  Then, when he saw how much powder I skied, he said
			he'd wished he made other plans.  Anyhow, this weekend, he was able to
			go.
		</p>
		<p>
			I understand it's hard to take a day for yourself when you've got a family
			and other responsibilities.  I probably take too much time away from family.
			John is more responsible than I am.
		</p>
		<p>
			He's also much fitter, way faster, and a way better skier than I'll ever be.
			Dispite our unmatched abilities, he was kind enough to wait up for me most
			of the day.  After our descent of BD12, in the time it took me to follow
			the track he layed back up to the ridge, he did some other big-drop, and then
			re-ascended the ridge just a few minutes after I finally reached it.
			I'm terribly out of shape.
		</p>
		<p>
			The first thing we skied was BD2 or perhaps it was BD3; I'm not sure.
			Before dropping in, I told John, "I'm turning my beacon on now."  There really
			wasn't a need to have them on until then.  Anyhow, mine read "zero battery!"
			I couldn't believe it.  I've solo toured about a million times, and always
			had beacon battery.  Now I finally tour with someone, and no juice!  I will
			have an extra bettery next time, and I'll check my battery before I leave.
			Fortunately, nothing slid on us.  Is it bad I didn't say anything?  I'm not sure.
			Typically, both he and I are solo touring anyway.
		</p>
		<p>
			I couldn't entirely follow John's skin track back up to the ridge from BD12.
			It got so steep, I had to start making my own shallower skin track.  Then it
			got steep enough that I had to just boot straight up the fall-line, using my
			skis and poles for boyancy.  It was terribly difficult.  I was sinking to my
			waist and chest in snow, all the while hoping I wouldn't trigger a wet slide.
			What's worse, my legs were so overworked, that I was starting to charley-horse.
			This is a sign of being out-of-shape.  I also started to charley-horse with
			almost every kick-turn on our last ascent of the day to regain B-ridge.
		</p>
		<p>
			It didn't help that for much of my ascent up John's track after we did BD12,
			my skins entirely failed in the sense that they got wet and started to pick
			up globs and globs of snow.  I could tell from John's tracks that he didn't
			have the same problem.  What this means is that on top of the extra 20 pounds
			of fat I was carrying, I was also lifting skis (globbed with snow) that
			weighed significantly more than John's.  At times, when it gets really bad,
			your tips and tails will hover half a foot above the snow, because you've got
			half a foot of snow globbed right under your feet.  It can be a really bad
			situation, especially if you have a long way to go to get out.  We used skin
			wax before we left, but it didn't last.  The snow was pretty wet all day.
		</p>
		<p>
			Our second-to-last run started out very safe, but the last bit rolled over to
			prime angles into a gully and obvious terrain trap.  John could ski it quickly
			and then cut out of the trap.  He has enough skill that he has a hope of skiing
			off of our away from an avalanche.  I suck so badly, though, that I'm constantly
			stopping mid-slope to catch my breath, so I would just get killed.
		</p>
		<p>
			When John skied the slope, he triggered an absolutely monstrously huge pin-wheel.  I've
			never seen one so big.  This was a scary sign of instability.  Of all the runs of the day,
			this one was probably not the smartest to do, especially with the terrain trap looming
			at the bottom, and my beacon dead.
		</p>
		<p>
			We exited via Rectangle Bowl.  I had drunken most of my water by then, and hadn't eaten
			enough food over the course of the day, because I was trying too hard to keep up with John.
			I should have brought more food, and food of higher quality, and insisted on taking the
			time to eat it.  More water would have been good too.  I was running on fumes from Rudy's
			flat all the way down to our trucks.  John waited for me at several spots.  I hope I
			wasn't too slow for him.
		</p>
		<p>
			John's a nice guy.  He never complained about how slow I was, and he complimented my
			crappy skiing.  I can tell he has a true passion for the mountains, and for backcountry
			skiing.  He's been skiing up B-ridge and beyond for years, and has probably skied just
			about everything you can up there.
		</p>
		<p>
			Admittedly, it was kind of nice to see John almost crash once; he never did, but
			he almost did; the conditions were quite variable.  One moment the snow was soft
			and easy to turn in, the next moment it was steering your skis; one moment it glided
			well, the next moment it ran so slow you felt like someone slammed on the breaks.
			We had some difficult spring-like conditions.
		</p>
		<p>
			Don't misunderstand, but I was also happy to see John get tangled up in a burried tree branch
			and fall over (something I've done about a million times.)
			His skis didn't clear the limb.  You see, John is so good he can make hair-pin
			turns around scrub oak in very tight spaces where there is very little room to ski.  So it's
			reassuring to see that even he can get tripped up some times.
		</p>
		<p>
			I want to learn how to jump-turn.  I saw him use that technique quite a bit.  It's clearly
			useful in situations where the snow wants to steer your skis, or where you need to make
			quick and tight turns, or when you want to take the sting out of the acceleration zone.
		</p>
		<p>
			At the end of the day I told John I hoped I skied well enough that this wouldn't be the
			last time we ski again.  He seemed positive we might ski again, so I'm happy about that.
			If I could just ski with someone like him once a season, that would make me happy.
