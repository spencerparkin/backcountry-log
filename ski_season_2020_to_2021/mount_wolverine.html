		The video above shows where people earlier skied Mt. Wolverine, but they did it at the right time.
		I was clearly too late.

		So far this season has turned out to be very disheartening.  As of this writing (12-23-20),
		our snowpack is, I think, lower than 50% of what it should be.  The skiing at Brighton has
		been pretty bad, and they still don't have the Great Western lift open yet.
		</p>
		<p>
		I've snowshoed up Bountiful Ridge (or just hiked up it) a few times, and there just simply
		isn't any snow deep enough to ski yet.
		</p>
		<p>
		The bigger story in all this, however, is the early November snow we got that, for several dry weeks after,
		just sat and rotted (faceted) over several cold, clear nights.  (A common pattern that occurs almost every season to a greater or lesser degree; mostly lesser.)  Now it's this terrible persistent
		weak layer that's plaguing the Wasatch on almost every aspect.  I've been trying to keep
		track of where it exists up on B-ridge, but I'm still going to be a bit nervous up there
		this year; that is, if we ever get enough snow up there.
		</p>
		<p>
		Anyhow, back to the outing shown in the video above.  There's not much to say.  It was,
		as you can see, pretty stupid.  But it was good to get out, and fun to explore the area.
		I've since been learning some basics in tuning and waxing my skis.
