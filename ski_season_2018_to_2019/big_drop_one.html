		This is the one and only time I went skiing with John-Mills--a fantastic skier.  His father is in
		my ward, and talking with him, it was funny to hear him say that his son (John), "thinks he owns
		the place," referring to Bountiful Ridge.  According to Owen, there was a long period of time when
		it was basically just him and John that frequented the area.
		</p>
		<p>
		I don't know why John wanted to ski with me in the first place, but I'm absolutely certain I disapointed him.
		Since the footage was taken above, I'd like to believe my skiing has greatly improved, but as you can see
		from the video, my skiing was just awful.
		</p>
		<p>
		I'm guessing that John waited somewhere between 15 to 30 minutes at his car while I was still trying to
		get down North Canyon road at the end of the day.  I'm always in full snow-plow mode going down that
		road.  I think he parallel skied the whole thing--something I could never do, even today with enough confidence
		to get down some of the double-blacks at Brighton's Milly lift.  (I never look good going down those runs,
		but I can get down them.)
		</p>
		<p>
		Needless to say, John was too busy to ski again the rest of the season.  But it was nice of him to ski
		with me at least once.
		</p>

		As the name somewhat-implies, there are multiple "big drops" beyond Black's Peak and the Burro Mine
		along Bountiful Ridge.  These are Ownen's names, and the area is often skied out by Wasatch Powder-Bird Guides.
