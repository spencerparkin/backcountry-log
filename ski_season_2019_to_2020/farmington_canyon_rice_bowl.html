		This was one of the more successful backcountry ski outings I've ever had.  No,
		the snow wasn't perfect by any means, but it was still fun, and nothing could have
		been more beautiful.  I theroughly enjoyed the deep blue sky, the evergreens, the aspens,
		the general alpine environment with its cool, crisp air, and just the charm of the place,
		from the spine itself to the Rice Bowl aspen glad, with its light and shadow.  It really
		was a neat day.  And seeing the sun-rise at the top of the mountain never gets old.

		Owen says he tries to ski Mud and Rice bowls at least once every year, and it's absolutely
		no mystery to me why.  He also says he has a lot of fond child-hood memories of skiing
		the place when the canyon road was plowed in winter for the radar people on Francis Peak.
		Since the road slid (some number of years ago), the FAA decided it was cheaper to just
		chopper their employees to and from the salt-and-pepper shakers maaring the chopped-off
		Francis Peak.  Even plowed, I would be quite nervous to drive Farmington Canyon road,
		so I'm good with the spine.

		I think I made reasonably good decisions this day.  I was early enough to get there before
		the snow finally thawed enough to be fun to ski near the top, even if it was always too
		crusty in the shade.  And I left before the sun made it too unstable.  I'm not very good
		at abserving, however, if there have been several overnight refreezes prior to a Spring ski.

		The Farmington Spine approach is beta I learned from a guy named Layne.
		His blog is <a href="http://l-caldwell.blogspot.com/">here</a>, I think.
		I'm also quite fond of Owen's blog <a href="http://wasatchsolo.blogspot.com/">here</a>,
		where I've learned a great deal about Bountiful Ridge (including KPF.)
