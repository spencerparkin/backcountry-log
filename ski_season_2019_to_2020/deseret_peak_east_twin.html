		Plans fell through to go up to Deseret Peak with Owen, so I just went alone.
		</p>
		<p>
		I knew the avalanche dragon was just going to be wet slides, which are much
		more manageable than slab avalanches, but of course, no less dangerous if you're
		caught and carried.  Wet slides are more likely to break at your feet while
		slab avalanches will typically break will above you--giving you little hope
		for escape.

		The snow didn't really soften up that day, because the sun never came out, except
		for one brief moment, and when it did, I was surprised just how powerful the heat was.
		If that had been aloud to continue, things would have become unstable pretty quick,
		so I was lucky it was overcast all day.  In fact, while exiting, a very thick fog
		enveloped the peak, which would have made the already-tricky rock-laden descent
		even trickier.

		As can be seen in the video, I did have one crash.  I'm glad this didn't happen higher
		up in the couloir, because I'm not sure I could have arrested the fall.  While approaching
		the couloir, it looks scary-steep, but once you're on it, you realize it's not that bad.
		I've skied much steeper at the ski resort.  Too much steeper than it was, however, and I might
		have backed off of it, and that's okay.  No one should ever feel bad about aborting an
		objective in the mountains.  Going home is the only requirement.
