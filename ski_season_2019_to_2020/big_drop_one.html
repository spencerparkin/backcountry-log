		So John will go and ski Big-Drop-1 by himself, probably because he knows he can
		get up there and back down in record-breaking time.  And he can do 20 laps on the
		thing in world-record time.  So why bring me along to slow him down?  In any case,
		if he did want a partner, I'm sure I'd be last on the list.  (Or not on the list at all.)
		</p>
		<p>
		Anyhow, I had heard that he recently went up there and skied the damn thing, and I guess
		I felt like I should go try to ski it too before the next storm.  (Just because a slope
		gets skied safely, that doesn't mean it's safe to ski!)  I felt conditions were safe enough,
		so I decided to copy-cat a great skier (John.)
		</p>
		<p>
		As can be seen in the video, whatever conditions John got, mine were certainly, let's say,
		less good.  I should have known better.  Much better snow could have been found on other
		aspects.
		</p>
		<p>
		To make matters worse, it took me over an hour to reascend the ridge, because the snow
		was so wet that my skins wouldn't work.  I had to boot it back up through the trees and
		use my poles to keep boyant in the snow.  It was terribly exhausting, and a bit scary.
		I was worried that a wet-slide would bury me.  The whole decision to ski this slope
		was just super, duper, dumb.
		</p>
		<p>
		This same exact day, Owen and his friend (I forget his name) was up on B-ridge
		skiing sensable snow.  Owen said he saw my skin track and looked for me, but
		didn't see me.  I'm sure they got in, did a few laps, and got out, all in the time
		it took me to go down BD1 once, and then make my painful exit.
		</p>
		<p>
		I had not yet met Owen in person at the time, so it was disappointing that I didn't
		meet up with him that day.  I later met him in person at the Hidden Lake Circle
		trail-head for Dude Peak.  We had a fun conversation.  We're both very enthusiastic
		about the mountains.  As far as getting together to ski, he told me not to take personally
		the fact that he never commits to a time and place to meet-up.  He said that over the years
		he's learned he has to be last-minute spontaneous due to the time-constraints of being
		a family man working full-time.  I certainly understand that, but apparently he's able
		to go last-minute with all his other ski partners.
		</p>
		<p>
		The only other big-drop run I've done is BD12.  It's a long way to BD12, and a long
		way back, but it's a beautiful, big open face with an exciting slope angle.
		I'm not sure how much of it I skied; I was scared of it, and skied off to the side
		after going down a few hundred feet or so.  While ascending back up along a ridge,
		I accidentally broke a cornice and almost fell down it.  It made a huge crashing noise,
		and created a bit of a slide.  One of the lessons here is that if you're not paying attention,
		the ridge configuration can change on you quickly.  In this case, the apex of the ridge
		was fine to travel on at the start, but turned into a corniced section before I realized it.
		Had I realized the change in ridge configuration, I would have dropped off the ridge onto the safe side, and then
		regained it further up.
