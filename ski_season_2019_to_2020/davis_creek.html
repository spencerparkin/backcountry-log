		What I recall is going up the Davis Creek trail on snowshoes only to wish I had brought
		my skis instead, so I came back a few weeks later, but by then, it was too late.
		Too much of the snow had melted for it to be as enjoyable as it could have been.
		In any case, the whole outing was pretty dumb, as can be seen from the video.
		</p>
		<p>
		I'm not sure it's worth going back at all.  There might be some fun skiing up there;
		I don't know, but it's very hard to access, and the terrain is quite complicated.
		The Davis Creek itself is a clear and obvious terrain trap.
		</p>
		<p>
		It might be worth it to come up the Old North trail to Mid-Way Peak, (which I did
		in my visit to <a href="bountiful_peak.html">Bountiful Peak</a>), but traverse over
		and come down the Davis Creek trail (which might be a better way down than the Old
		North trail itself.)  I know there are many interesting gladed sections
		up along the G2-connector (George's Grand Connector), but again, it's very hard to
		get up above tree-line to experience the area, and hard to get back down below it.
		</p>
		<p>
		This outing also re-enforced the need in my mind to learn how to wax my own skis.
		I have since learned to do this.
