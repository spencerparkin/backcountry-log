		The best skiing off Bountiful Peak, I've heard, is on the east side, going down the shoots.
		The west side is much more mellow, and that's what I skied this day.

		A day or two later, John Mills, surprisingly, called me over to help him move a couch out
		of my neighbor's house.  He asked if I'd skied anything lately, and when I told him about
		Bountiful Peak, he then asked if it was all wind-jacked.  He was spot on.  I'm not sure
		if that's because he's tried the same place, or if he derived the conclusion from his
		snow senses.  I should have asked.  In any case, I screwed up the social encounter, as always.

		As I was skiing back down the ridge to Mid-Way Peak, I thought to gain some speed in order to
		ski up a short up-hill section.  This proved to be a big mistake.  I was going down some really
		hard and bumpy wind-slab which bucked me off my skis so hard that I popped out of both tech bindings!
		I was very lucky to not get hurt, and that I was able to find both my skis a short distance away.
		They could have gone sliding down the side of the ridge.

		I took the Old North trail to Mid-Way peak on approach thinking it would be possible to ski down
		some of it.  I gave up not long after leaving Mid-Way peak.  It was too steep and too confined.
