		This day feels so long ago; I'm not sure I can remember much about it.
		</p>
		<p>
		I don't recall why I thought the slopes I rode would be safe to ride.  I'll bet it
		was purely based on the UAC forecast, and there being a fair length of time between
		the outing and the last storm, so that the snowpack could adjust.  In any case, I wouldn't
		be surprised if I didn't have any legitimate reason to be riding those slopes.
		I was still pretty new to B/C skiing, and probably making a lot of bad decisions.  I still
		make bad decisions (e.g., skiing alone--not exactly a choice, but still...)
		</p>
		<p>
		It's usually impossible to know if a slope is safe to ride, so the trick is being able
		to make an accurate essessment of the risk based on accurate information gather from own personal observations as well as those of others (such as, e.g., the UAC.)  Then, if the risk
		is high, you simply don't do it.  If the risk is medium, you simply don't do it.  If the risk
		is low, then, well, maybe you do.
		</p>
		<p>
		In any case, making an informed decision is always better than just riding the slope without
		knowing anything.  If you play it that way, the odds are not in your favor.  You will eventually
		get caught and carried in a slide.

		Conditions shown in this video were quite good relative to most conditions I've found
		up there.  This was fairly early season, so hitting rocks was still a bit of an issue,
		but as shown in the video, the snow was pretty nice.
		</p>
		<p>
		On this particular outing, I was caught out in the dark high up on the ridge, several miles from my car.
		Fortunately, I had my headlamp, it had enough batteries, and I was able to follow my
		tracks back out to Rudy's Flat, and then the trail down North Canyon.
		Traveling in the dark is always spooky, but somehow feels a bit better on skis
		than on foot.  (I've hiked out on foot in the pitch black dark on many occations, and that is
		no fun at all.)
		</p>
		<p>
		As a side note, on a similar outing, I also got caught out in the dark, but without
		a head-lamp.  It had been overcast all day.  I said a prayer.  Then the sky cleared and
		the moon came out.  It's not often you can travel clearly by moonlight, but I did.  I skied
		all the way back to my car by the light of the moon.  Prayer answered?  I think so.  It was surprising just how much moonlight there was and how easy it was to see.
		</p>
		<p>
		But back to this outing.  I'm not sure if it was this one or another, but one time
		skiing down the North Canyon trail in the dark by headlamp, I whacked my eye-ball lens
		on a tree branch.  No joke!  It was terribly painful, and admittedly, it made me cry for a bit.
		I really feared I might have vision problems after that, but I seemed to have made
		a full recovery from it.  The lesson learned?  Safetly glasses are not a bad idea
		when bushwacking, especially at night.  Sun glasses will also work, but of course,
		not at night.
