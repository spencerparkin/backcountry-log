		While driving on the free-way, I can't help but look up at the mountains
		occationally to scope out potential ski terrain (not a safe practice.)
		One such place scoped out was the terrain up above Ward canyon, or the
		Stone Creek drainage.
		</p>
		<p>
		There is stuff to ski up there, but as shown in the video, it gets overrun
		by those darn motorized ski-bike things.  I really, really hate the smell
		of those damn machines.  One reason I go to the mountains is to get fresh
		air, and those machines completely negate that purpose.  Plus, it's hard
		to have to deal with the consequences of other people's actions, especially
		since they either ignorant of how they're affecting your, or worse, they just
		don't give a damn.  It's like being stuck on the ski lift when the chain in
		front of you is full of pot or cigarette smokers.

		I made the really poort decision to exit via Stone Creek rather than go back
		the way I came on this day.  First, the snow was getting warmed, and so
		it was also becoming unstable, and any canyon is going to be a possible
		terrain trap in such a case where it gets narrow with steep side-slopes.
		Fortunately, I didn't get burried.  Second, snow was sticking to the bottom
		of my skis, so they wouldn't slide on the snow.  There wasn't much of
		anywhere that I could ski (because it was such a bush-whack), but I couldn't
		even ski where there was room to ski, which was frustrating.
		</p>
		<p>
		Had I not had some familiarity with where the trail went in this canyon,
		the exit could have been much worse.  Fortunately, I knew where I needed
		to be to avoid some difficult obstacles, and I was able to get out; and
		before the sun went down, even!
		</p>
		<p>
		One of my bindings malfunctioned on the exit, and I didn't bring any tools
		to fix it.  I managed to use a safety pin as make-shift slotted screw-driver,
		but I've sinced learned to always bring some kind of tool I can use to
		adjust my tech-binding.
