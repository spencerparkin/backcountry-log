		When viewing the Session's Mountains range, one potential ski line stands out above all
		others, and it's the one coming down the highest point along this "range" which is a sub-ridge of the Wasatch Range back-bone.  It falls to the south-west (from what I'm just going to
		call Session's Peak) down into a drainage called Rocky Basin up top, and Willey Hollow
		nearing the bottom where it converges with Mueller Park Canyon.
		</p>
		<p>
		Not only is the line aesthetically pleasing in my mind from a distance, but it is also a beautiful
		place when you're emerced in it.  The aspect isn't ideal, but the area and line itself, I think,
		are really neat.
		</p>
		<p>
		This is one of the great things, I think, about backcountry skiing.  You see a line off in the distance,
		dream about skiing it, and then you go and make it happen.  The video above actually shows my 2nd descent
		down this particular line.  I did not have a GoPro camera for my 1st descent, which was under better
		conditions, but unfortunately, however, I wasn't as good of a skier at the time.  I'd like to believe
		that I have improved since then.
		</p>
		<p>
		As can be seen from the video, conditions this 2nd time around where pretty bad.  It really didn't
		matter if I had gotten there later, because as was forcasted for this particular day, the sun was
		never going to be strong enough to soften the snow.  Though a solar aspect, this particular line
		needs a bit more time than most to soften up, because it is shaded by the sub-ridge on skier's left
		for most of the morning.  This is actually a good thing, because it gives you more time to arrive
		at the peak, which is already difficult to reach.
		</p>
		<p>
		The last half mile or so along the ridge to the summit is the most difficult, and there are
		a few tricky and exposed sections.  I'm thinking that next time I try this peak, I will drop
		into Holbrook Canyon, then skin up to the GWT (Great Western Trail), from which it is an easy-breezy
		hike up to Session's Peak.
		</p>
		<p>
		I approached this time by going up the gas pipeline in Meuller Park canyon.  Then exited via
		the Kenny Creek trail.  This works out nicely, because the pipeline is a quick open approach
		without any tree-line difficulty in reaching the top of the mountain, and because you can
		ski a good portion of the Kenny Creek trail to and from the old broken-down cabin.
		</p>
		<p>
		On my first attempt, I approached via the Holbrook Canyon trail-head going up by the old
		Christmas Tree farm to gain the ridge.  I went back the same way, but lost the trail and
		ended up bushwhacking to the bottom of Holbrook Canyon, and happy to find the trail at the bottom.
		I recall fording all the streams on the way out, too tired to try or care to keep my feet
		dry.
		</p>
		<p>
		The ski line featured in the video is over 30-degrees.  I don't think I've measured it (I should have),
		but I'm sure it's well over 30.  So it's a line I'd be too afraid to try mid-winter by myself.
		I've only tried it as a Spring ski when I'm confident we've had several freeze-thaw cycles to
		weld the snow into place.  On the day of the attempt, it's then just a matter of skiing the face
		late enough that the snow softens, but not too late that it's become destabilized by the heat
		of the sun.
