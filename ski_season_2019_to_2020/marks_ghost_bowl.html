		On this particular day, most people would have turned back long before reaching an area of
		Bountiful Ridge known as Mark's Ghost.  This was truly an epic day, because not only did
		I go up there with low expectation, but even those expectations were crushed on the approach.
		Just about everything was awful conditions.  That is(!), except for the blessed, shady,
		north-east aspect of Marks' Ghost Bowl, which has since become my favorite place to ski off the ridge.
		</p>
		<p>
		Mind you, however, it is also the most dangerous aspect in the central Wasatch (and the
		Northern Hemisphere in general.)  This bowl is also the lee side of Bountiful Ridge, so
		it is often wind loaded.
		</p>
		<p>
		Anyhow, I was confident in skiing it this day, because the avi-rose had been fully green for
		quite some time (hence the crappy ski conditions everywhere else.)  This particular spot,
		however, to my great satisfaction, and surprise, kept and preserved some fantastic powder, no
		doubt due to the aspect and shade provided by the trees.
		</p>
		<p>
		I've read that the art of backcountry skiing is all about being in the right place at the
		right time.  In this case, I nailed it!  I didn't know at the time that Marks' Ghost Bowl was going to be a
		good bet when everything else was crappy, but I certainly do now!
		</p>
		<p>
		The name of this area (and all the runs off Bountiful Ridge), were given by a guy named
		Owen Reeder who has skied this area since the early 70s, or perhaps earlier.  I'm not sure
		if anyone else has skied it earlier or what names they used, but the names I use come from
		him.  I've held several correspondances with him (via e-mail) over the last few years, and
		come to know him as a very respectable man, and quite knowledge about the mountains.
		</p>
		<p>
		He has his reasons for each name he's given each peak, bowl and run.  In this particular case,
		Mark is in reference to his late brother.  After his passing, Owen recalls seeing him up
		here on one of his outings, and I hope he doesn't mind me saying so.  That experience, I'm sure,
		is sacred to him, and I respect that.
