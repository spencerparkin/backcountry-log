		There is sometimes just one day during the entire winter when it pukes so much
		white stuff that you can actually ski some of the low-elevation terrain.
		On one such occation, I decided to ski the north-ridge of Holbrook Canyon.

		The video shows the whole descent in un-edited, pain-staking detail.
		A good skier (like John), I imagine, could have zig-zagged down the
		whole thing with skis parallel, even the steep narrow parts of the trail.
		Knowing I would certainly crash if I attempted such a thing, I just
		eeked my way down.
